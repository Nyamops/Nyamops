My name is Danila Shvets. I am a software engineer working in the Moscow, Russia. With over 4 years of experience writing code of many kinds, I've managed to write a lot of PHP, Go, JavaScript, C# and Lua script.

Many of my recent projects have inspired me to use Go as the primary language for server-side programming.
